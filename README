Simple Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple Package Manager (SMP), as the name suggests is a simple package manager.
It is intended to operate in similar way to existing package managers (e.g apt,
dpkg, Pacman, etc). Instead of supporting a centralised package repository, SMP
allows remote packages to be downloaded and installed automatically given thier
URL (Universal Resource Locator). This allows a developer to package and 
distribute their software via a package management system without having to 
worry about the many different formats and Linux distrbution repositories.

How to Build and Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to install this software you must have root privlige access. This might
mean that you have to get an administrator to install it for you. The software 
can be built and install simply by using the command:

su
make install

alternativley you can use sudo if you have it configured correctly:

sudo make install

How to Use SPM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commands
========

spm-create     Creates a new .spm package.
spm-install    Installs a package.
spm-uninstall  Un-installs a package.
spm-get        Manages remote packages.

Command Usage
=============

spm-create
----------

Usage: spm-create <package name> <install script> <un-install script> 
              <build script> <license file> [package file ...]

Note: 

 * The install, uninstall, build script and license files are nessesary, but
   they can be replaced with a '-', which creates an empty file. 

 * The package name will be suffixed with the ".spm" extension if it is not 
   already.


spm-install
-----------

Usage: spm-install <package file ...>

Note:

 * You may reqiure root privileges (depending on the install script for the 
   given package).


spm-uninstall
-------------

Usage: spm-uninstall <package file ...>

Note:

 * You may reqiure root privileges (depending on the uninstall script for the 
   given package).

spm-get
-------

Usage: spm-get <mode> <package url ...>

Mode:
    get       - only download package (to ~/.spm).
    install   - install the package.
    uninstall - un-install the package.
    delete    - delete the given package file (not un-install).
    purge     - delete all downloaded packages (in ~/.spm).

Note: 

 * The curl program is used to provide this functionality and therefore the same
   protocols and URL formats are supported.

 * Downloaded packages are kept in under .spm/ in the current users home 
   directory.

 * You may reqiure root privileges (depending on the install script for the 
   given package).

.spm Format
===========

The .spm file format is simply a gzipped archive with a special filesystem 
heirarchy. Their are four special purpose file (install, uninstall, build and 
license) which are described below, as-well as a directory call data that holds
the packages files. These files are as follows:

install    An executable that installs the package.

uninstall  The is an executable file that un-installs the package.

build      This is an executable file that builds the package.

license    This file contains the licensing terms and conditions of the package
           This is set by the spm-create command when it makes a package.

The first three of these files can be any executable code including scripts or 
compiled programs.

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

The current code base for SMP is tiny (only ~700 lines!), and so developers are
not required at the moment. However bug reports and fixes are welcomed and 
should be submitted using the issue tracking system provided on the projects 
google code website (http://http://code.google.com/p/simple-package-manager/).
