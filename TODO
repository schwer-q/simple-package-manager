SPM TODO List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains work that needs, or should be done on the codebase. If you 
have any suggestions, bug report and/or fixes please feel free to email me (the
project owner) at zscott@zscott-dev.info. You can also use the issue management
system of the google code homepage (code.google.com/p/simple-package-manager/).

================================================================================

Add repository database - Zachary Scott <zscott@zscott-dev.info>

Status: incomplete

Description:
Add the ability to download and search for packages from a central repository.
This feature would have to be configurable in the case that the server moves,
or other repos are created.

Implementation Suggestions:
Add another command to spm-get (called search, maybe) to search for a package 
from a list file on the server (this can be done over HTTP). Then download the
package from its name relative to the repo server. For example

$spm-get search spm

Search Results:
spm-0.1.1-rev2.spm

$spm-get install spm-0.1.1-rev2

...

================================================================================

Add GUI to Makefile - Zachary Scott <zscott@zscott-dev.info>

Status: incomplete

Description:
The compliation, installation and packaging of the GUI code needs to be added to
the Makefile. It should NOT be default to compile OR install the gui, until the 
next version is released. 

================================================================================

GUI performance optimisation - IMPORTANT - 
    Zachary Scott <zscott@zscott-dev.info>

Status: incomplete

Description:
The performance of the GUI system needs to be heavily optimised. The current 
package reader system is un-acceptably slow. Once this is complete and the GUI
is stable enough I will release the next version.

Implementation Suggestions:
The package should be extracted using (the much faster) tar program. The program
can then work off the directory structure. Much of the spm.format classes and 
interfaces can be kept the same in this case but thier implementation would have
to be heavily modified.
